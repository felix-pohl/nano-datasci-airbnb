Data Exploration for Datascience Nanodegree with Udacity.

## Project

Explore a dataset with the CRIPS-DM process and pose 3 business questions that will be explained to a non technical audience in a blog post.

In my notebook I want to answer these 3 questions:

- Which season is favoured for a cheap visit?
- Should I rent on the weekend or workdays?
- Are listing with more reviews more expensive?

## Conclusion

After some exploration I was able to find clear answers for my questions:

- Q: Which season is favoured for a cheap visit?
    - A: Autumn or winter bar new year's eve
- Q: Should I rent on the weekend or workdays?
    - A: Best would be tuesday, never on friday or saturday
- Q: Are listing with more reviews more expensive?
    - A: Reviews do not appear to have a big impact
